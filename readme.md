## Pyramid Panic – A Game of Tactical Geometry  🚀

Hey PICO‑8 pals! I’m brewing a snappy 3–4‑player skirmish where every pyramid you fling can flip the table. Try it, break it, tell me what hurts!

---

### Quick Pitch
Redirect lasers? Nah—redirect **pyramids**! Stack attacks, juggle defenses, and overload your rivals before the buzzer.

---

### Controls
Each player drives one cursor with **three modes** (cycle with ⬅️ / ➡️):

| Mode | What it does |
| ---- | ------------ |
| **Attack** | Plant an 8‑pixel pyramid aimed at any defender. Hitting your own defender scores **0** but still fuels Overcharge. |
| **Defend** | Keep a defender alive at all times. Lose it and you’ve got **10 s** to drop another or you’re out. |
| **Capture** | Triggered by Overcharge—snatch an attacker pointed at your defender, then redeploy it anywhere. |

---

### Scoring
We recalc right after every placement:

* **Attackers** earn **1 pt** if **2 +** attackers point at the same defender **of another color**.  
* **Defenders** earn **1 pt** if facing **0 – 1** attackers.  
* Everything else = **0**.

Each player totes **6 pieces** → **36 pyramids** max in a 4‑player frenzy.

---

### Overcharge ⚡
Three or more attackers locking on one defender? That defender **Overcharges**. Its owner gets an instant **Capture** move before play rolls on.

---

### Endgame
* **3‑minute** round timer, **or**
* Player 1 may end early by holding both buttons **5 s**.

Highest score wins. Tie = sudden‑death; first point steals the crown.

---

### State of the Panic
Alpha build live! I need your hot takes on:

* Attack/defense balance  
* Is six pieces each spicy enough?  
* Can you always tell which cursor mode you’re in?
