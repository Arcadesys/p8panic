Pyramid panic is a game played by 3-4 players that focuses on redirecting attacks

All players have cursors with the following three modes

attacker- points a pyramid that is 8px high toward a defender. an attacker may only be places when successfully pointed at a defender. the player may choose to point an attacker at their own defender, in which case that attack scores no points. (It does, however, count for purposes of calculating overcharge, below)

defender - places a defender. A player must _always_ have a live defender in play; if they fail to place a defender within 10 seconds of losing their last defender, they are out of the game.

- capture - allows for the capture and re-placement of enemy pieces attacking your defender.

after every piece placement, recalculate the score of the game.


# Scoring

Every piece placed either scores 1 point or 0 points.

- attackers succeed if there are 2+ attackers pointed toward the same defender. if that attacker is pointed at a defender of its own color, it scores no points.
- Defenders succeed if there are 0-1 attackers pointed at the same defender.


Every player has six pieces to place, totalling 36 for a game with max players.

# Overcharge (capture)
if a defender has 3+ pieces pointed at it, that defender is considered _overcharged_ and entitles its owner to perform a capture action. from the capture cursor, the defender player may pick up any attacker attacking that defender. they may then place that piece, maintaining its color, anywhere on the playfield.

The game continues for 3 minutes or until player 1 ends the game early by holding both buttons down for five seconds. Highest score wins.
